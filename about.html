      <h1>About Ian</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Ian, and I build stuff. By trade, I'm a software engineer, but
        creating is a hobby to me as well as a career. I write code because I
        think software can have an incredible impact on people's lives, so I'm
        constantly coding up new ideas that I think could provide value.
      </p>

      <p>
        By clicking around this site, you'll notice that I start lots of
        projects, and they're not all code related. In fact, a lot of my current
        projects are programming-adjacent. For example, I started a podcast
        called
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxT9KWCmrCJYW_OHKATmp9A"
          target="_blank"
          >Greenpoint Dev</a
        >
        where I and co-host
        <a href="https://nikhildhawan.com/" target="_blank">Nikhil Dhawan</a>
        discuss a variety of topics in software engineering. I've also been at
        work writing for
        <a href="https://lgtm.beehiiv.com/" target="_blank"
          >a newsletter called LGTM</a
        >
        that delivers weekly emails telling you tech news with a funny tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love to share the things I create because I want my work to have a
        positive impact on others. What's the point of building something great
        that nobody uses? This is why I'm often energetic on social media.
        Starting conversions online and contributing to communities is a great
        way to get feedback on my projects and establish a platform where I can
        reach more people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Feedback and meaningful conversations are critical when creating things
        that people will enjoy. If you send me an email, I will read it. If you
        want to get on a call and chat, just ask. You can even join
        <a href="https://discord.gg/cuqpTfjntW" target="_blank"
          >my Discord server</a
        >
        and start the conversation there.
      </p>

        I hope you enjoy your time on this site. You can learn more about the
        site by looking through the code in
        <a href="https://github.com/iankranz/ians-portfolio" target="_blank"
          >my portfolio GitHub repository</a
        >. If you want to stay in touch, I write a
        <a href="https://iankranz.substack.com/" target="_blank"
          >monthly newsletter</a
        >
        that gives updates on what I've been working on. I highly recommend
        subscribing for a quick and interesting read every month. In any event,
        thank you for the visit, and I hope you have a pleasant day.
